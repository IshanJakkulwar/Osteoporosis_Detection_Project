# Osteoporosis Multi-Regional Classification

### A Novel Multifocal Transfer Learning Neural Network Model for Early, Accurate, and Cost-Effective Detection of Osteoporosis via Radiographs

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based model to detect osteoporosis and osteopenia from knee and spine X-ray images using transfer learning. The goal is to provide a cheaper, more accessible alternative to DEXA scans, particularly for low-resource settings.

The best-performing model uses **EfficientNet-B0** and achieves:
- **Accuracy:** ~87.5%
- **Recall:** 80%
- **Precision:** ~70–75%
- **F1 Score:** 0.719

> Developed by Ishan Jakkulwar at Queen Elizabeth’s School Barnet, under the mentorship of Michael Noonan.

## 📉 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric     | Best Score |
|------------|------------|
| Accuracy   | 87.15%     |
| Recall     | 0.800      |
| Precision  | 0.700      |
| F1 Score   | 0.719      |

- **Confusion Matrix**: Used to understand false positives and false negatives
- **ROC-AUC**: Assesses the model’s ability to distinguish between classes

## 🔍 Results

The EfficientNet-B0 model outperformed all others, proving highly effective despite a relatively small dataset. Training and test losses indicated minimal overfitting. The model shows promise for clinical integration to support early diagnosis and reduce fracture risks.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Expand the dataset (diversity in age, sex, ethnicity)
- Integrate with hospital imaging systems
- Explore ensemble methods or larger architectures
- Improve real-time diagnostic capabilities
